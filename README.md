## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the frontend running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
* npm or yarn
* A running instance of the [**backend server**](httpss://github.com/mirdanish6594/Resume-Screener).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_FRONTEND_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure the Backend Connection:**
    The frontend needs to know the address of the backend API.
    Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project directory and add the following line:

    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=[http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
    ```
    *Note: Replace `http://127.0.0.1:8000` with the actual URL where your backend is running.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
